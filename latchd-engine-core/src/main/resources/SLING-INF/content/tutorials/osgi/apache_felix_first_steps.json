The primary reason it remains a mystery to the development world lies in its lack of beginning level tutorials or classes. This tutorial attempts to begin a series of labs to demystify the OSGi framework and begin familiarity with Apache Felix."

There are, however, a plethora of OSGi frameworks to choose from and can have fun downloading and trying a few others out. Keep in mind, while some of the other frameworks will make things considerably easier, they may in fact, deviate from the OSGi Alliance’s original specifications. If we work in Felix we are almost certain to be R4 compliant."
